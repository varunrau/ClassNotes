Version #2: 2/4/13 4:50pm
#1.) Users shoudn't be able to eff with google docs sharing configurations
#2.) IMPORTANT PROBLEM: English R1A students can go in and destroy Mexican R1A's notes unchecked. Stop access to certain notes by students who don't have that class. That's the problem, we'll have to think of a solution...
#3.) The UI has changed so that it's not that nice royal blue gradient thing, and has light blue. I personally preferred that complete royal-blue-gradient thing that michael had.
#4.) For the lecture list, put the days of the week for lectures, and also index them. In fact, it should be something like:
	Lec #1
		Circuits
			Monday, 2/4/2013
	Lec #2
		Kirchoffs Laws
			Wednesday, 2/6/2013
	...

Notice how the lecture has a subtitle, which is the name of that lecture, which would be a nice feature. We don't need to put that subtitle in yet, but later on we should implement it. The date and lecture should be listed in that style though for sure.
#5.) Change "What would you like to learn?", which is the wrong thing kinda, to something more like "Choose a class :3" DONE
